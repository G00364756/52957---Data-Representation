### Lab1: Create HTML page
File name: lab1.html

This file contains code developed as a solution to the Lab 1 exercise of the module 52957.
The objective of Lab 1 was to create a HTML page named carviewer.html with;
1. A create button
2. A table
3. A form

Extra credit is assigned for styling the webpage to look a bit nicer using tools such as bootstrap.
